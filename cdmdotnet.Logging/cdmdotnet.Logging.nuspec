			This logging library makes large use of enterprise correlation.
			In a lot of applications that incorporate various small and large services, it is often important to correlate events that happen across these services. It gives us a business workflow view of the various events that happen in the application, its components and services.
			This library provide operation and activity ID management and propagation.

			The main difference with this library over other is that you can configure each type of log separately. You can enable fatal, error, warning, debugging, informational, progress and sensitive data logging all independently of each other.
			This is more flexible than the concept of minimum level logging, such as that in log4net or serilog e.g. enabling one warning in this libraries will enable error and fatal logging as well. This library allows you to set those settings independently of each other.

			The SqlLogger maps AdditionalData to table columns, where the key of the dictionary entry is the column name and the value is serialised to JSON as the column value.
			MetaData is serialised to a single JSON value stored in the MetaData column.
			This means you can store data such as a User ID or Job ID in a separate column so you can filter more efficiently with indexes and partitions.

			TraceLogger and ConsoleLogger both seralise and format all information into a single string.
			The MultiLogger allows you to configure several different loggers to be used at once with different settings for each logger.

			Usage is in the form of:
			static void Main()
			{
			  ICorrelationIdHelper correlationIdHelper = new WebCorrelationIdHelper();
			  // This value will be set automatically to all logs within this thread... so long as System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Factory.StartNew is used.
			  correlationIdHelper.SetCorrelationId(Guid.NewGuid());
			  DoSyncWork();
			  DoAsyncWork();
			}

			static void DoSyncWork()
			{
			  ILogger logger = new SqlLogger();
			  logger.LogDebug("Some technical debugging details.");
			}

			static void DoAsyncWork()
			{
			  System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Factory.StartNew(() => {
			    ILogger logger = new ConsoleLogger();
			    logger.LogInfo("An informative message.");
			  });
			}

			This package installs cdmdotnet.Logging.dll with includes core logging functionality. Other packages depend on cdmdotnet.Logging for specific implementations.

		<releaseNotes>
			Version 1.2.93

			* Replaced a few usages of collections with better thread safe collections for much higher usage environments.

			Version 1.2.92

			* Added a null reference check to the configuration file base settings class to return a better error if there is an issue.

			Version 1.2.91

			* Added better support for serialisation issue with exceptions and meta-data - which are both considered secondary to trying to save all other information.

			Version 1.2.88

			* Added a sample SQL script for creating the logs table, see the tools folder.

			Version 1.2.87

			* Added the ability to turn off using performance counters. You may need to add a new property to your app.config or web.config "UsePerformanceCounters" with a boolean value.

			Version 1.2.77

			* Added optional properties to all telemetry methods.

			Version 1.2.74

			* Added Telemetry.

			Version 1.2.65

			* Refactored all loggers to use a simplified classes for more consistency.

			Version 1.2.60

			* Added MultiLogger.

			Version 1.2.58

			* Added the ability to specify the table to be used in the data so you can separate systems into different tables but have them all in the same DB
			* Fixed poor handling of a missing connection string configuration.

			Version 1.2.52

			* Switched to using (and referencing) cdmdotnet.Statemanagement for controlling the passing of the CorrelationId from thread to thread safely when using Parallel Tasks.

			Version 1.2.51

			* Added Logger settings as a better default when using app.config and web.config files.

			Version 1.1.49

			* Replaced the threaded model with Parallel Tasks.

			Version 1.1.48

			* Resolved an issue where a NullReferenceException if AdditionalData was null.
			* Added some documentation to explain how MetaData and AdditionalData is stored.

			Version 1.1.46

			* Remove cdmdotnet.Logging.Sql

			Version 1.1.45

			* Resolved an issue where a NullReferenceException could be raised during logging.
			* Merged SqlLogger into cdmdotnet.Logging.

			Version 1.1.39

			* Added MetaData property
			* Added AdditionalData property
